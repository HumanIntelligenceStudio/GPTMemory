# GPTMemory
# OperatorOS Memory System

Welcome to the OperatorOS Memory Loop — a human/AI hybrid architecture for externalized memory, reflection, and automated project clarity.

## 🔍 Purpose

This repo is used to:
- Archive ChatGPT/Claude transcripts
- Log system design, prompt loops, and AI-assisted decisions
- Capture identity and interaction style in plain Markdown
- Automate reflection and prompt iteration

## 📁 Structure

```
/reflections/           ← daily reflection inputs (morning.md, evening.md)
/logs/                  ← raw .md exports from chat systems
/persona/               ← identity and tone files
/projects/              ← technical memory per project (chunked + merged)
/templates/             ← reusable prompts and launch files
OperatorOS_README.md    ← this file
```

## 🧠 Files You’ll See

- `operator_persona.md`: your assistant identity + tone
- `Operators_KnowledgeBase.md`: merged Claude/GPT-friendly output
- `morning_reflection.md`: clarity anchor for loop opening
- `chunk_01.json`: input conversation export
- `chunk_01_Operators_KnowledgeBase.md`: processed result

## 🔄 Workflow

1. Upload `.json` or `.html` export to Replit app
2. File is processed, chunked, and converted into `.md`
3. Final `.md` is saved with timestamp and original filename
4. Reflections and decisions are added manually or scripted
5. The repo becomes your executable memory vault

## ✅ Why It Matters

OperatorOS is built to remember:
- What matters
- How you work
- And how to bring yourself back to center

Every `.md` file here is a map of what you already know.
